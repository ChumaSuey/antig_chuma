### General Information / Behind the scenes.

This map was an experience to do, Jam started when i was traveling with my family, i didn't have stable internet only from mobile data and my computer was also used by my family in some inquiries.

During vacations i did a small playtest room and thanks to the deadline extension (or else i couldn't have finished it) i started working my way on finishing the map... It's a chumastic Alkaline map with a serious theme/tone.

I've used most of the anti gravity features for the map, the climax room where gravity was high was a suggestion of Shark, i had no idea what i was going to do with it, so it came at the right time to implement.

The original idea for the map was a map in the middle of space, a space station where you would jump from certain parts to another, and the keys would spawn randomly with trigger_random.

The trigger_random was used in a couple of parts in the map: the weapons in the beginning and PU secret.

The PU secret thanks to Fabio's help actually is triggered with an action rather than crossing it, this was one of my favorite things in the map.

I thank Mopey for motivating me to include Difficulty balance, like i usually did : Easy/Normal - Hard/Nightmare are how my maps are usually balanced, one thing to say is that i always map for Nightmare as default, so Hard/NM is recommended.

I thank OJ for giving me feedback on how to use func_lasers to delimit some parts that have player clips, it was a very creative idea that helped a lot for the environment of the map.

The idea was changed so i could do something cool and stable in less time, i liked how the map came to be.

It has textures from Quake 1 (mg1.wad) , Quake 2 (q2tex00.wad) and quake 3 (q3a_sm204.wad).

I thank Fabio (bmFbr) for the extension and helping me out on the map, Alkaline is my favorite Quake mod of all time <3.

Enjoy my map, Excelsior!


Best vibes and high fives for all of you!

A special tribute mention to my friend Meowgi from the Doom Community for helping me for mapping into doom, leading Pacifist Paradise community and never stopped believing in me.  <3
