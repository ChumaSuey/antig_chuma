### General Information / Behind the scenes.

This map was an experience to do, Jam started when i was traveling with my family, i didn't have stable internet only from mobile data and my computer was also used by my family in some inquiries.

During vacations i did a small playtest room and thanks to the deadline extension (or else i couldn't have finished it) i started working my way on finishing the map... It's a chumastic Alkaline map with a serious theme/tone.

One thing 


### Special thanks

A special shoutout to Ribbiks and dannebubinga for making Sunlust (Doom wad) as it's aesthetic and a bit of difficulty dynamics have inspired my mapping skills in a sort of way. <3

A special tribute mention to my friend Meowgi from the Doom Community for helping me for mapping into doom, leading Pacifist Paradise community and never stopped believing in me.  <3
